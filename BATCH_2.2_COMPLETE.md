## MFA Flow Examples

### Enrollment Flow
1. User requests MFA setup
2. Generate TOTP secret and QR code
3. User scans QR code with authenticator app
4. User enters verification code
5. System verifies code and activates MFA
6. System generates 10 backup codes
7. User saves backup codes securely

### Login with MFA
1. User enters email and password
2. System checks if MFA is enabled
3. System checks if device is trusted
4. If not trusted, prompt for MFA code
5. User enters TOTP code or backup code
6. System verifies code
7. Optional: Trust device for 30 days
8. Login successful

### Recovery Flow
1. User initiates MFA recovery
2. System sends recovery email (24h expiry)
3. User clicks recovery link
4. System verifies token
5. System disables current MFA
6. System removes all trusted devices
7. User can re-enroll MFA with new device

## Next Steps for Deployment
1. [ ] Apply database migration in production
2. [ ] Test MFA enrollment flow
3. [ ] Test MFA challenge during login
4. [ ] Test trusted device functionality
5. [ ] Test backup code usage
6. [ ] Test recovery process
7. [ ] Set up pg_cron for cleanup (optional)

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Complete MFA system with enrollment, challenge, trusted devices, backup codes, and recovery!
