# Infrastructure & Launch Checklist (Production)

This guide covers setting up the production environment and launching safely.

## Vercel (App hosting)

- Link repo to Vercel project
- Set environment variables (see Developers â†’ Deployment)
- Configure regions and edge/runtime as needed
- Protect preview deployments if required

## Supabase (DB, Auth, Storage)

- Create production project
- Apply migrations from `supabase/migrations`
- Configure Auth (email templates, MFA policies)
- Enable PITR and automated backups
- Set CORS and storage bucket policies

## Stripe (Payments)

- Create products/prices and map to catalog
- Set webhook endpoint to `/api/stripe/webhooks`
- Store `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Vercel
- Run `scripts/upload-stripe-products.ts` if using automated sync

## CDN for video delivery

Options:

- Cloudflare Stream or Bunny Stream (recommended for HLS and analytics)
- Supabase Storage + signed URLs + caching (simple)

Document chosen provider and update player configuration.

## Domain & SSL

- Alerts on 5xx rates, slow endpoints, and webhook failures

## Backups & recovery

- Supabase PITR enabled
- Weekly logical dumps stored offsite
- Restoration test performed

## Data migration

- Import legacy courses using scripts
- Validate counts and sample content
- Run test migrations in a staging environment first
