## Current Configuration

**Development/Testing:**
- FROM: `onboarding@resend.dev` (Resend test email)
- TO: `admin@therabrake.com` (account owner only)
- Status: ✅ Fully operational

**Production (Pending Domain Verification):**
- FROM: `noreply@therabrake.academy`
- TO: Any email address
- Status: ⏳ Requires domain verification at resend.com/domains

---

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Verify Domain in Resend**
   - URL: https://resend.com/domains
   - Domain: `therabrake.academy`
   - Action: Add DNS records provided by Resend

2. **DNS Records to Add** (will be provided by Resend):
   - TXT record for DKIM
   - MX record (optional, for receiving)
   - SPF record (automatic)

3. **After Verification**
   - Test with: `curl -X POST https://therabrake.academy/api/email/test`
   - Can send to any email address
   - Production ready

## Email Integration Points

The email service is automatically triggered from:

1. **Authentication** (`app/api/auth/`)
   - Welcome email on signup
   - Email verification
   - Password reset

2. **Enrollment** (`app/api/stripe/webhook/`)
   - Enrollment confirmation after payment

3. **Certificates** (`app/api/certificates/generate/`)
   - Certificate delivery on course completion

4. **Payments** (`app/api/stripe/webhook/`)
   - Payment receipts
   - Payment failure notifications

5. **Security** (MFA flows)
   - MFA codes for 2FA
